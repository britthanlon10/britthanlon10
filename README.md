### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### My name is Brittany, but you can call me Britt!
##### I work as a Private Child Care Provider in St. John's, NL.
As a recent graduate from Memorial University, I had planned on a second degree in Education but then came across Get Coding and decided to take a different approach to teaching. I plan to use my interest in software development and educating children to teach future generations how to code!

- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on my first Get Coding module 
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m starting to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I rock climb inside and outside in my spare time! ðŸª¨
